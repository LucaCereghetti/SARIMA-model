# SARIMA Forecasting â€“ Theory and Implementation

This repository combines both the **theoretical foundation** and the **practical implementation** of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, applied to financial time series data.

## Repository Structure

- **1 - Data explanation.pdf**  
  Description of the dataset and preprocessing methodology.

- **2 - SARIMA.pdf**  
  Theoretical background of the SARIMA model, including autoregressive, moving average, integration, and seasonal components.

- **3 - Performance Metrics.pdf**  
  Explanation of the evaluation metrics used to assess forecasting accuracy.

- **ARIMA.R**  
  R script implementing ARIMA/SARIMA models, including data loading, model fitting, and forecasting.

- **AAPL_prices.csv**  
  Sample dataset (Apple Inc. stock price data) used in the analysis.

- **LICENSE, .gitignore, .gitattributes**  
  Standard repository configuration files.

## How to Use
1. Read the PDFs for an overview of the **theoretical aspects** of SARIMA and the evaluation metrics.  
2. Run `ARIMA.R` in R to replicate the implementation of ARIMA/SARIMA forecasting.  
3. Use `AAPL_prices.csv` as input data to test and replicate the analysis.  

---

ðŸ“Œ **Key idea:** The PDFs provide the **theoretical context**, while the R script demonstrates the **practical forecasting workflow** using ARIMA/SARIMA.
